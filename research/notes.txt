I was inspired by Unfiltered Audio's plugin LO-FI-AF, which contains a number of nonstandard lo-fi distortion effects such as radio interference and low-bitrate MP3s. Of the options, CD skipping caught my eye, and led me to ask the question of how to emulate it.

I burned an audio CD with a linear sine sweep from 30 Hz to 8000 Hz over 5 minutes.

I took a boxcutter and made a notch on the label side of the CD (I tried the reflective side but nothing happened, see https://www.quora.com/Can-a-scratched-CD-still-work-How?share=1). Then I connected the headphone output of the CD player to an audio interface and recorded playback to Audacity. The result is single_notch.wav, which contains skips and clicks.

I added three more notches, and the CD outright refused to play at first, but on the second try it worked (four_notches.wav).

The CD clicks for irregular large skips -- nothing special there -- but evenly-spaced glitches for small forward skips. A glitch generates a waveform which consists of:

- a burst of quasiperiodic noise lasting 90 samples
- some Nyquist oscillations (alternating samples) for ~110 samples
- 18 samples noise burst
- 16 samples Nyquist oscillations
- 48 samples noise burst
- a decaying Nyquist oscillation (not important)

The entire glitch seems to be mostly additive with the original signal. Sometimes it is quieter or louder.

The bursts of noise are quasiperiodic with a period of exactly 6 samples. The 6-sample wavetable evolves over time and seems to be related to the input signal. I would simulate it using a random walk on each of the 6 samples.

Glitches are stereo with the right channel happening roughly 150 samples after the left channel. This creates a nice little Haas effect. Glitches are spaced evenly, at approximately 0.134 seconds in between.

In one instance, I encountered a full dropout lasting several seconds. The audio resumed in the same place where it was before the dropout.

The results of this experiment are highly dependent on the CD player. I used a relatively high-end one (it doubles as a Blu-Ray player), and these experiments would likely work better on older and cheaper CD players with worse error correction mechanisms.

I ordered a $20 CD player whose Amazon reviews complain of lack of skip protection. That's perfect for us. After running a scratched CD, I found that the glitches are not fundamentally different from those in the expensive CD player, but far more frequent. I extracted a few glitch samples for analysis, the results of which can be seen in the glitches/ folder.

In glitch_001.wav, the left channel is delayed by 177 samples. The glitch happens simultaneously with a skip. The first half of the glitch depends on audio before the skip, while the second half depends on audio after, if that makes sense.

Left channel:
- 3 periods of 6-sample quasiperiodic noise
- 2x:
    - 6 samples of dc offset
    - 2 periods of 6-sample quasiperiodic noise
- 6 samples of dc offset
- 12 samples sine-wave-like oscillation, period 12 samples
- 6x, slightly quieter each iteration:
  - 2 periods of 6-sample quasiperiodic noise
  - 12 samples sine-wave-like oscillation ("jostled" variant of previous oscillation)

Right channel:
- 5x, slightly louder each iteration:
  - 2 periods of 6-sample quasiperiodic noise
  - 12 samples sine-wave-like oscillation, period 12 samples ("jostled" variant of previous oscillation)
- 36 samples Nyqist oscillation
- 24 samples noise, period 12 samples, consisting of one positive sample and 11 negative samples
- 12 samples quasiperiodic noise, period 6 samples, consisting of one negative sample and 5 positive samples
- 12 samples noise
- 2x:
    - 18 samples quasiperiodic noise, period 6 samples, consisting of one negative sample and 5 positive samples
    - 6 samples sine-wave-like oscillation, period 6 samples
- Decaying Nyquist oscillation

It is beginning to sound like a crude Markov chain, even if only first- or zeroth-order, may be a wise approach to emulating this behavior.

Stereo delay: 177 samples?

Left channel:
- 2x:
  - 6-sample spike (3 samples ascending, 3 samples descending). Note that the signal here is negative, so the spike could be a sign inversion.
  - 18 samples dc offset
- 6 * 8 samples quasiperiodic noise, period 6 samples
- 2x:
  - 6 samples positive spike
  - 18 samples quasiperiod noise that spikes negatively, period 6 samples
- 5x with decreasing amplitude:
  - 6 samples positive spike. At this point the original signal is negative
  - 18 samples silence
- decaying 6-sample positive spikes

Right channel:

- 4x with increasing amplitude:
  - 6-sample positive spike. Again the original signal is negative,
  - 3x 6-sample negative spike.
- 5x: 6-sample positive spike followed by 18 samples of silence.
- 40 samples of 6-sample quasiperiodic noise.
- 18 samples noise.
- 18 samples quasiperiodic noice that spikes negatively, period 6 samples. At this point the original signal is positive.
- 6 samples sine-wave like oscillation, period 6 samples
- 1-sample negative spike followed by 11 positive samples
- 1-sample negative spike followed by 5 positive samples
- 1-sample negative spike followed by decaying positive samples
